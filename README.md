# DataStructures

Code developed while learning DSA from the "The Ultimate Data Structures & Algorithms: Part 1, 2, 3" by "Mosh Hamedani".

## Learning outcomes:
The first part is all about linear data structures and their algorithms:

Big O Notation,
Arrays,
Linked Lists,
Stacks,
Queues,
Hash Tables

The second part covers non-linear data structures and their algorithms:

Binary Trees,
AVL Trees,
Heaps,
Tries,
Graphs

The third part explores:

Searching Algorithms,
Sorting Algorithms,
String Manipulation Algorithms
